This is Shi Wang, Associate Professor from [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn), Beijing, China. I am mainly engaged in the fields of knowledge graph, natural language processing, and neural-symbolic dual-process computing. Specifically, I focus on integrateing symbolic knowledge with deep learning to realize dual-process cognitive computing for natural language reasoning involved tasks. Research papers were published in AAAI, WWW, EMNLP, ACL and other international top conferences.

I am supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, the National Information Security Program, Beijing NOVA Program, etc.

I welcome all undergraduate students who have solid foundation and like thinking differently to accomplish practical and interesting research which can really change something. Feel free to contact me!

Research interests
==

* Knowledge Graph
--
My research on knowledge graph focuses on automatically knowledge discovery from unstructured/simi-structured data such as text, wiki pages or heterogeneous tables. For example, we extract particular person/time/location and their relationships from newspapers. Knowledge graph is the fundamental resource for many nlp and other intelligent applications, or even considered to be the bottleneck of true AI.

* Natural Language Processing
--
My research on nlp focuses on dialogue system, multi-hop machine reading comprehension, and text generation. For example, we build task-oriented chat-bot using knowledge graph or text, or automatically write financial report using sale tables. NLP is one of the major field in AI and widely used in information retriving, recommandation, online advertising, and many other products.

* Neural-Symbolic Dual-Process Computing
--
Deep learning implemented by neural network has some limitations including zero-shot learning, interpretability, and noise sensitive, etc. Does human begings learn really from big data? We believe integrating symbolic knowledge graph or logic rules with vectorized model in a dual-process way is a closer simulation with human brains. It is a frontier research direction in intelligence science domain.
