is Shi Wang, [Professor from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/201612/t20161205_4716469.html), Beijing, China. I am mainly engaged in the fields of LLM based NLP,  robotic dexterous hands, and neural-symbolic dual-process computing. Specifically, I focus on integrating symbolic knowledge with deep learning to realize dual-process cognitive computing for LLM based natural language reasoning involved tasks. Research papers were published in AAAI, WWW, EMNLP, ACL and other international top conferences.

I am vice secretary general of Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence(CAAI) Mind Computation Committee, member of TCM informatization professional committee, Beijing chronic disease big data professional committee. I am supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, the National Information Security Program, Beijing NOVA Program, etc.

I welcome all undergraduate students who have solid foundation in computer science or mathematics to accomplish practical and interesting research which can really change something. Feel free to contact me!

Research interests
==

* LLM & NLP & KG
--
My research in LLM & NLP mainly focuses on training large language models and investigating their mysterious features such as emergence effect, hallucination, COT, etc. We also fine-tune LLMs for NLP applications including dialogue system and text generation. LLM-based-NLP is widely used in information retrieving, recommendation, online advertising, and many other important products.


* Robotic Dexterous Hands
--
Dexterous hand is one of the core components of robots. In this field, we want to investigate physics-informed reinforcement learning in order to improving the generalization capabilities of dexterous hands, including synthetic data generation, VLA model post-training, task planning, etc. Additionally, we explore sim2real technology to accomplish multi-tasks in real world.


* Neural-Symbolic Dual-Process Computing
--
Deep learning implemented by neural network has some limitations including zero-shot learning, interpretability, and noise sensitive, etc. We believe integrating symbolic knowledge graph and logic rules with vectorized deep learning model in a dual-process way is a better simulation. Research topics include symbolic knowledge representation, dual-process NN structure, and knowledge enhanced LLM, etc.
