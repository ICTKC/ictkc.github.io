Dear Shi Wang,

We are glad to inform you that your submission 342 to DASFAA 2022 has been accepted as a full paper.

We hope that you will find the reviews and meta-reviews useful in updating the camera-ready version.

We are also extremely sorry for the delay in the notification. Many of the reviewers and meta-reviewers got affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Thank you once again for submitting to the conference.
We hope to meet you all there.

Regards,
DASFAA 2022 PC Chairs
